// Theory of operations: this class keeps a list of currently known libraries,
// identified by name and linkage, along with functions and references,
// and maintains structures sufficient to maintain following API:
//  - add a library, obtain unique integer library id (if already added, reuse)
//  - remember that an address is associated with library id (used)
//  - remember that library is being used
//  - obtain vector of all libraries, for which such association exist
//  - bind address to function without explicitly using it
//  - record reference between two addresses and retrieve target by source
// Library manager differentiates known vs. used functions and libraries.
// Known library/function is just registered in the manager, but we don't claim
// they are used by currently analyzed item.
// Used library/function is explicitly referenced by an analyzed item.
